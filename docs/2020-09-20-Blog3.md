## OMG! I forgot!
That was so stupid that I totally forgot about this blog project, so I missed the due for Blog2.  
Anyway, I created Blog2 after the due even though I knew it is not going to be seen. It is like a little bit of OCD mind that I would not be comfortable if I skip Blog2 on my blog list.

And I learn a new **technique** during the process of creating [Blog 2](/2020-09-18-Blog2/), so let me talk about that.  
(Yes, I emphasize the word "technique", why not? lol )

## How to add images?
This assignment is the first time to me to use `Markdown Language`, and I learned some syntax from the example of supported [theme page](https://pages-themes.github.io/leap-day/). I think this is very instinctive language that really easy to write.

I got used to those syntax not long after I began this blog project, and I added links to the page, and insert images from some websites occasionally, but I didn't know how to insert my own image such as a screenshot from my work.

The syntax to insert image is:
```
![Description of image](the path of image)
```
I used this a couple of times in Blog 0 and Blog 1 to insert images I found from some website.  
And I wanted to use my screenshot to talk about how I did for some assignments, and first I created png image from my screenshots and put it into `/docs/_posts` directory of my repository, then put the image name inside the parenthesis, well it doesn't work.
Then, I tried to put project path like `docs\_site\image.png` but it still doesn't work.

Next, I went to [this theme Github page](https://github.com/pages-themes/leap-day) to see README.md, but no tips, I also look for a directory where the image could be contained. There is a directory named "assets" at same layer with docs and it has a directory "images", but there is no hint to figure out how the images are used.

## Ok Google!
(By the way I am an iPhone user and Alexa is in the living room, so I never ever said this out loud)
90 % of IT job is googling! Then, I found the website [Upload Images to Github's CDN](https://gist.github.com/vinkla/dca76249ba6b73c5dd66a4e986df4c8d)  
This is exactly I am looking for!

1. First, visit any repository on GitHub and click your way through to the issues page.
2. Create a new issue by clicking the New Issue button. You'll now see title and description fields.
3. Drag-and-drop an image onto the description field. This will start the uploading process.
4. Copy the URL and use it in README, issues or pull requests however you like.

I think I would never figure out that I needed to create "issue" to upload images.  
By the way, I am still not sure what README.md should look like, so I didn't put this to there as step #4 mentions, but I think I will do someday....

### They are too Big
Okay, now I can see the images on the page, but it seems each image is too big in the page.  
![PageScreenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/93720990-ddbfc500-fb41-11ea-8268-dddda26575be.png){:height="400px" width="350px"}

I tried this syntax to resize the images
```
![Description](https://image.png =350x20)
```
It doesn't work

```
![Description](https://image.png width=350 height=200)
```
Next!
```
![Description](https://image.png | width=350 height=200)
```

It is not only not resizing, but also doesn't show the images.

Some people say that just editing in html instead of md file.
I went to the hidden directory `_site` to find html file for Blog2, then I added as
```
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/93692410-ce8c3900-faa7-11ea-908e-c9904611d0e5.png" width="350" height="200" alt="Docker" /></p>
```
And refresh local page,

It works!!  

![ResizedScreenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/93721424-0d240100-fb45-11ea-9510-256ccb14ad78.png){:height="300px" width="350px"}

Okay, I wanna commit to see exact page.
First to check `git status`...

![GitStatus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/93721257-8ae70d00-fb43-11ea-801b-b6c91f32d0a0.png){:height="100px" width="350px"}

Wait, why there is no the html file I changed to resize?
Anyway, let me commit and push...

And open the page...

![PageScreenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/93720990-ddbfc500-fb41-11ea-8268-dddda26575be.png){:height="400px" width="350px"}

Oh no, they are not resized!!

My assumption about this issue is because the html file is dependent to md file, so even if the html is edited, it always to be back as reflection of md file. Therefore, I need to edit md file to resize the images. (Please feel free to point me out if this assumption is not correct)  

But I tried already those md syntax and thy didn't work, how could I....

Then, I found [this GitHub Gist page](https://gist.github.com/uupaa/f77d2bcf4dc7a294d109) And somebody posted:  
![resizeSyntax](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/93721258-8b7fa380-fb43-11ea-8063-34d8f815c532.png){:height="100px" width="350px"}

I tried the second and third one, both work :)

Since I adjust almost all images to similar size, I believe it should be set in CSS, but for now it would be next homework...
