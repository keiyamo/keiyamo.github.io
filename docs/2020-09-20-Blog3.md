## OMG! I forgot!
That was so stupid that I totally forgot about this blog project, so I missed the due for Blog2.  
I created Blog2 after the due even though I knew it is not going to be seen. It is like a little bit of OCD thing that I would not be comfortable if the Blog2 does not exist on my blog list.

And I learn a new **technique** during the process of creating [Blog 2](/2020-09-18-Blog2/), so let me talk about that.  
(Yes, I emphasize the word "technique", why not? lol )

## How to add images?
This assignment is the first time to me to use `Markdown Language`, and I learned some syntax from the example of supported [theme page](https://pages-themes.github.io/leap-day/). I think this is very instinctive language that really easy to write.

I got used to those syntax not long after I began this blog project, and I added links to the page, and insert images from some websites occasionally, but I didn't know how to insert my own image such as a screenshot from my work.

The syntax to insert image is:
```
![Description of image](the path of image)
```
I used this a couple of times in Blog 0 and Blog 1 to insert images I found from some website.  
And I wanted to use my screenshot to talk about how I did for some assignments, and first I created png image from my screenshots and put it into /docs/_posts directory of my repository, then put the image name inside the parenthesis, well it doesn't work.
Then, I tried to put project path like `docs\_site\image.png` but it still doesn't work.

Next, I went to [this theme Github page](https://github.com/pages-themes/leap-day) to see README.md, but no tips and look for a directry where the image could be contained. There is a directory named "assets" at same layer with docs and it has a directory "images", but there is no hint to figure out how the images are used.

## Ok Google!
(By the way I am an iPhone user and Alexa is in the living room, so I never ever said this out loud)
90 % of IT job is googling! Then, I found the website [Upload Images to Github's CDN](https://gist.github.com/vinkla/dca76249ba6b73c5dd66a4e986df4c8d)  
This is exactly I am looking for!

1. First, visit any repository on GitHub and click your way through to the issues page.
2. Create a new issue by clicking the New Issue button. You'll now see title and description fields.
3. Drag-and-drop an image onto the description field. This will start the uploading process.
4. Copy the URL and use it in README, issues or pull requests however you like.

I think I would never figure out that I needed to create "issue" to upload images.
I am still not sure what README.md should look like, so I didn't put this to there yet, but my next target might prompt to edit README...

### They are too Big
Okay, now I can see the images on the page, but it seems each image is too big in the page.  
I tried this syntax to resize the images
```
![Description](https://image.png =350x20)
```
It doesn't work

```
![Description](https://image.png width=350 height=200)
```
Next!
```
![Description](https://image.png | width=350 height=200)
```

It is not only not resizing, but also doesn't show the images.

Some people say that just editing in html instead of md file.
I went to the hidden directory `_site` to find html file for Blog2, then I added as
```
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/93692410-ce8c3900-faa7-11ea-908e-c9904611d0e5.png" width="350" height="200" alt="Docker" /></p>
```
And refresh local page,
