When I saw this Blog projects instruction, I thought I need to start early this because this is the first opportunity for me to use `jekyll`, and I am not familiar to `Github` either.

Then, I found the website [Setting up a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll
](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll). First it seems so simple to do, but I realized I was wrong not long after.

As prerequisites:
*   Set up `Github`
*   Install `Ruby`
*   Install `Bundler` ( this is optional, but you'd better to do! )

### Setting up Git
1. Download and install the latest version of Git.
2. Set your username in Git.
3. Set your commit email address in Git.

Here, I was still confused with `Git` and `Github` that I was like "Didn't I already set up username??" for second part, but realized `Git username` and `Github username` are different. However, the third part, this is actually about setting up email address in `Github!` Now I think that many people using `Git` and `Github` interchangeably, well, I think I have to get used to...

Btw, I didn't install `Github Desktop`, I use `Git Bash` to access the local repository and commit instead. `Git Bash` is an application for Microsoft Windows environments which provides an emulation layer for a Git command line experience...means I can use bash command to operate Git on Windows.

### Creating a repository for your site

***Create a new repository***

***Name the repository***

***Choose a repository visibility***

 If you use Github free account, you can't set as private, and for this assignment it is required to be public so that our Professor Lisa is able to access our page.
 However, it is good to know that students can use Github Pro for **free** let's thank for `Github Student Developer Pack`. It is always nice to be a student lol.



**Okay, from now on things getting ~~crazy~~ complicated!**
