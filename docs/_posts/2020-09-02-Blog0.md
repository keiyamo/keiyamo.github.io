When I saw this Blog projects instruction, I thought I need to start early this because this is the first opportunity for me to use `jekyll`, and I am not familiar to `Github` either.

Then, I found the website [Setting up a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll
](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll). First it seems so simple to do, but I realized I was wrong not long after.

As prerequisites:
*   Set up `Github`
*   Install `Ruby`
*   Install `Bundler` ( this is optional, but you'd better to do! )

### Setting up Git
1. Download and install the latest version of Git.
1. Set your username in Git.
1. Set your commit email address in Git.

Here, I was still confused with `Git` and `Github` that I was like "Didn't I already set up username??" for second part, but realized `Git username` and `Github username` are different. However, the third part, this is actually about setting up email address in `Github!` Now I think that many people using `Git` and `Github` interchangeably, well, I think I have to get used to...

Btw, I didn't install `Github Desktop`, I use `Git Bash` to access the local repository and commit instead. `Git Bash` is an application for Microsoft Windows environments which provides an emulation layer for a Git command line experience...means I can use bash command to operate Git on Windows.

### Creating a repository for your site

1. Create a new repository

      ![new repository](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/repo-create.png)

1. Name the repository
   ![name repository](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/pages/create-repository-name-pages.png)

1. Choose a repository visibility
   ![visibility](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/create-repository-public-private.png)

 If you use Github free account, you can't set as private, and for this assignment it is required to be public so that our Professor Lisa is able to access our page.
 However, it is good to know that students can use Github Pro for **free** let's thank for `Github Student Developer Pack`. It is always nice to be a student lol.



**Okay, from now on things getting ~~crazy~~ complicated!**

### Creating your site ###

1. Open terminal
    - Command Prompt, Git Bash, anything you like
1. Create working directory

1. Initialize a local Git repository
    - run `$ git init [repository name]`
1. Change directory to the repository
    - run `$ cd [repository name]`
1. Decide publishing source
    - I chose master/docs
1. Create docs directory and change directory to it
    - run `$ mkdir docs`
    - run `$ cd docs`
1. Create a new jekyll Site
    - run `$ bundle exec jekyll [version] new .` if you installed Bundler.
      (Dependency version is 3.9.0 right now )
    - run `$ jekyll [version] new .` if no Bundler

I got some errors from those process. For example, when I specific the version 3.9.0, then it didn't start install. And later, I received the email that says "Page build failure due to missing /docs". So, I rerun again after I confirmed there is /docs, but failed several times.

In our lecture, actually I was ~~glad~~ relieved when our professor Lisa got same error as I did ( about jekyll version ), I was like "Oh I am not alone!" haha.

In Sep 1st Tuesday lecture, Lisa showed whole process from beginning even deleting existing repository!

* Delete the existing repository ( On Github )
* Create new one, choose public, and add READ.ME
* Clone the repository at your local (delete if you still have the old repository)
  - run `$ git clone [copied URL] `
* Create /docs and change directory
  - run `$ mkdir docs`
  - run `$ cd docs`
* Create a new jekyll site
  - run `$ jekyll new .` ( note that no specify version)
  - now it creates genelic files in /docs
* Move up to repository directory to check git status
  - run `$ git status`
* You see modified file/directory name in red, then add
  - run `$ git add .` ( . means all file, specify name is good practice)
* Then, check status the name in green now, then commit and push
  - run `$ git commit -m "[comment, what you did]"`
  - run `$ git push`
* Back to Github, and refresh page to confirm /docs appears

* Go setting, then choose source "master/docs" and save

## Ta-da! ##

*OMG* finally I created the blog site!!!!!

It blew my mind that how it is so simple!!!
There are more stories like how I set up themes to my blog site, but let me tell you in later post.

Until then, Chao!
