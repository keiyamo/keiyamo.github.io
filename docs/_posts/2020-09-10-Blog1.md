## Set theme to my Blog

I wanted to set a theme to my blog before I create any new post because themes' construction may vary, so I thought it would be complicated to set a theme if the theme's construction is different from original theme "minima"

I picked this theme [Leap-day](https://github.com/pages-themes/leap-day#:~:text=The%20Leap%20day%20theme,or%20even%20use%20it%20today.) from the list of Github Pages [supported themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/)
