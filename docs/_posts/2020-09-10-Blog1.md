## Set theme to my Blog

I wanted to set a theme to my blog before I create any new post because themes' construction may vary, so I thought it would be complicated to set a theme to existed post if the theme's construction is different from original theme "minima". To be honest, it is not a quite true, but I am glad I did this, so now only thing I need to do is writing about what I did, yay!

I found this video is really good to learn how to change the theme. My professor Lisa also recommended when I asked a question about changing a theme.

[![jekyll tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/NoRS2D-cyko/default.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoRS2D-cyko&t=318s){:height="200px" width="350px"}

I picked this theme [Leap-day](https://github.com/pages-themes/leap-day#:~:text=The%20Leap%20day%20theme,or%20even%20use%20it%20today.) from the list of Github Pages [supported themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/)

First I got this error that says compatible jekyll version to this theme is up to 3.3 while the jekyll version I have installed is 4.1.1, so I need to downgrade jekyll.

```js
  Bundle could not find compatible versions for gem "jekyll";
    In spapshot (Gemfile.lock)
      jekyll (= 4.1.1)

    In Gemfile:
      jekyll (~> 4.1.1) x64-mingw32

      jekyll-theme-leap-day x64-mingw32 was resolved to 0.0.4. which depends on
        jekyll (~> 3.3) x64-mingw32
```

I edited `Gemfile` to downgrade jekyll version as:
```
  gem "jekyll", "~> 3.3"
```

Next thing I needed to do is change the `layout` Since this theme's layout format is only `default` while "minima" has `post`, `page`, and `home`.
When I run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, I got error that says those layout don't exist. And if you put `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` to your browser to see the file, it shows nothing, completely blank page.

Therefore, I needed to change all layout format to `default`.

This process is shown at `04:48` of the video I mentioned above. I was so glad that it shows exactly how to fix when I got the blank page after I changed the theme. This was really helpful!!
