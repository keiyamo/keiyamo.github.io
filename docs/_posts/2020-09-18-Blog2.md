## Lab 1 LAMP stack

This lab I need to install LAMP stack by using `Docker`
I didn't really know about Docker until this assignment, my understanding about Docker was like a Virtual environment.
Actually it is much more than that.

I remember I installed LAMP stack through Virtual Box for the assignment of CIT210.
So, installation parts are like reviews, but setting up Docker environment is new to me.
I occasionally heard it is easy on Mac but not Windows, especially if it is Home edition. Then, first comes up in my mind is "Should I upgrade to pro?", but it costs $99.
My old laptop I used till last Fall semester has Windows 10 pro, but new one only has Win 10 home edition.

I remember that even though old laptop is Win 10 pro, it has only 4GB RAM that it always becomes upset whenever I use virtual environment. That is main reason I bought new laptop.
(I really love Surface Pro, my laptop, but one thing I hate is I can't extend its spec like adding memory or replacing battery because it is sealed and I am afraid to lose the warranty! (*/∇＼*))

## Docker Toolbox

So, I decided to stay Win 10 Home to do this assignment.
According to [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/) using `Docker Desktop` through WSL(Windows System for Linux) is the first option for Win 10 home user.

However, that caught my eye is `System requirement`,
```
Install Windows 10, version 2004 or higher. The Docker Desktop Edge release also supports Windows 10, version 1903 or higher.
```

Umm, now my win 10 version is 1903, and right now I am not willing to upgrade to 2004 because I heard there could be some [issues](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/05/28/dont-press-windows-10-2004-update-now-button-microsoft-warns-some-users-may2020-windows10-update-warning/#1e6fa79b6fc0)
Microsoft is trying to fix those, but I am not ready for yet.

Here again, question to myself "Is it okay to stay 1903 to use Docker Desktop?"
Further googling, I found a website "[Docker on Windows 10 Home](https://medium.com/@mbyfieldcameron/docker-on-windows-10-home-edition-c186c538dff3)".  this site a little bit old that it is written two years ago, but it seems still good to go, so I tried it.

The article suggest two option
1. Install Docker Toolbox on Windows 10 Home (mentioned above),
2. Install a Linux virtual machine (VM) on our Windows OS, and then Install Docker Community on the VM.

I picked first one to try.

- Preparation
  - Check that your system has Virtualization enabled. Enter your machine’s BIOS and enable virtualization.
  - Once your computer boots up, make sure that Hypervisor is turned OFF. (it should be off by default)

### Install Docker Toolbox
 I installed three apps
  - Docker Quickstart
  - Oracle VM Virtual Box (since this is new laptop)
  - Kitematic (Alpha) (I am still not sure what this app is used for)

  I launched `Docker Quickstart`

  Everything goes smooth except the last part, and that one is actually I need to get screenshot!
  After I installed Composer, tried to open the page in local 192.168.99.100:8080, but I got this

  So, I go back to the beginning then created another container that use Ubuntu:18.04 as demonstration video by Lisa shows, but I got same error.

  This is happening at Sep 10th and original due for Lab 1 was Sep 11th, so I was about to ask professor to help, but then I realized she had just extended the due to Sep 18th!! Yay! ﾍ(=￣∇￣)ﾉ


  I attended the lecture on the Saturday, and after class a classmate asked professor about the same issue I had.
  She said Ubuntu:latest which is ver 20.04 might have issues to install composer, yeah okay that makes sense but then why I still have same issue after I tried the container with Ubuntu:18.04?

  I was watching whole process professor instructed the classmate how to fix it. Then I realized she said to run "apt-get install zip" after installed composer, then it works!!

## Ta-da!

  The zip is used for some dependencies that run during the composer install.

  This is what I wanted to see!
