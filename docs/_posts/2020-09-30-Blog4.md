## Lab2 Dockerfile

This lab I need to create `Dockerfile`.  
A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.  

Lab 2 requires me to create a Dockerfile to build a custom image that will run the affinity web application which we did in Lab1.  
Even though it says I have the freedom to design the Dockerfile, but I simply added most commands I used in Lab1 into `Dockerfile`.  
This sounds very simple assignment, but it was not that easy to me.  

This is an simple example of Dockerfile.  
![fileExample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/94781376-9675d780-037e-11eb-8d0e-474cb36422e2.png){:height="150px" width="550px"}

These are good references for Dockerfile
  - [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd)
  - [Docker CLI & Dockerfile Sheat Sheet](https://design.jboss.org/redhatdeveloper/marketing/docker_cheatsheet/cheatsheet/images/docker_cheatsheet_r3v2.pdf)

First thing first, let's create `Dockerfile`!

## I can't save the file!!  

I am using Docker Toolbox, so first I tried to create a Dockerfile under  
`/c/Program Files/Docker Toolbox`  
where I always start when I use Docker, so I run   
```
vi Dockerfile
```
and added these for a test  
![testFile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/94781427-a988a780-037e-11eb-9f4a-514358a539af.png){:height="200px" width="350px"}

but when I tried to save and close the file, I got this error  
![saveError](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/94781451-b2797900-037e-11eb-93c8-58629d0f5d4a.png){:height="25px" width="450px"}

??? this is a permission error that I can't create any file under the directory, and I can't even change the permission, then where can I create the Dockerfile???

According to [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd),  
>  In most cases, itâ€™s best to start with an empty directory as context and keep your  
>  Dockerfile in that directory. Add only the files needed for building the Dockerfile.

So, I go to my home directory, created a directory named `lab2` then I created test Dockerfile inside the directory.  
![lab2dir](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/94781472-bc02e100-037e-11eb-8450-92018ec35704.png){:height="70px" width="450px"}

and then I run
```
$ docker build -t [image's name] .
```

Now I see a new image named "lab2" was created, so I create a container and run to see if apache2 is already installed
```
$ docker run -it -p 8080:80 --name [container name] lab2 bash
```
**yes! apache was installed!**

### ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND noninteractive

I need to mention that you need to put `ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND noninteractive` so that it doesn't prompt to enter the geographical area during building the image.  
(This depends on the original image you use to create Dockerfile, ubuntu:18.04, or 20.04 I am sure you need to put it)

This site explains more about [DEVIAN_FRONTEND](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/explain-debian_frontend-apt-get-variable-for-ubuntu-debian/)

## How to edit the files

During the process of LAB1, I edited several files.  
There are two ways so far I know to add the process in Dockerfile
 - Use `COPY` command
 - Use `sed` command

Using `COPY` command, first you pull out original files from a container (or the container you already created in Lab1, then you don't need to edit)  
I need to edit these files.
 - `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf`
 - `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`

Since the example is already given in Lab2 instruction pdf, so I wanted use `sed` command for first one.
```
RUN sed -ri -e 's#DocumentRoot /var/www/html#DocumentRoot /var/www/html/public#'
/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
```

However, I kept got an error like this  
![UnknownS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/94781500-c9b86680-037e-11eb-8b56-4574a8372241.png)

I tried several things like  
 - add "g"
  - `s#DocumentRoot /var/www/html#DocumentRoot /var/www/html/public#'g`
 - change delimiter
  - `s|#DocumentRoot /var/www/html#DocumentRoot /var/www/html/public#|'`
 - even omit "s"

But nothing works.  
What the most I wonder was when I tried same command inside the container's home directory, and it works, it changed the text of the file, but not in Dockerfile.

I asked professor Lisa to help, and she immideately pointed out two things
  - I missed "s" (yeah I think I forgot to put it back after I tried without "s")
  - There is no space between the last ' and /etc/apache2....

**Space!**  
**Omg A SPACE!!**

This is not the first time to try to fix an error and tried several things but can't figure it out, and eventually found out it was because of A SINGLE SPACE! (I should have learned this)

Anyway, it works now.  
For second file '/etc/apache2/apache2.conf', I used `COPY` command, this one is much simpler.

You copy out from a container which installed apache2, so run  
```
$ docker cp [container id]:[file path]
```  
So, in my case
```
$ doker cp 5201d5b38b6e:/etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```  
Then, edit the file as it should be and save it in same directory where Dockerfile is.

## Completed...?

Okay, I put every command it needs in Dockerfile, so let's test.

- Build the image --Ok!
- Create a container with the image --Ok!
- Start apache2 in the container --Ok!
- Open 192.168.99.100:8080 on a browser --------- not ok???

**WHY???**

I checked if every configure is correct, and I found this in apache2.conf  
![apache2Conf](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/94781561-e05ebd80-037e-11eb-9ffe-580e113c9608.png){:height="220px" width="400px"}

Oh no, it is missing "html"! in `var/www/public`  

I corrected and tried again  

 ![Notfound](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/94781535-d8068280-037e-11eb-968f-dbfaafa0fb1d.png){:height="200px" width="400px"}

Still same....  
I compared with the container I created for Lab1, everything is same except...  

![missingSymbolLink](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/94781614-eeacd980-037e-11eb-8c3a-5b1950bd2897.png){:height="60px" width="550px"}

**Wait, where is the symbolic link!?**  
I put the command to create the symbolic link, so where it goes??  
In what directory I should run the command?

Then, I remember this  
![symbolicLink](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/94781631-f4a2ba80-037e-11eb-9a34-f3d21593500c.png){:height="90px" width="500px"}

Alright, I forgot `cd /var/www/html` command before the command of creating the symbolic link!

## Now it's done!
Ok, here it is!  
![WebService](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/93693208-a570a600-fab1-11ea-809d-de0abaf2f96c.png){:height="200px" width="350px"}

Although, this time I didn't use `EXPOSE` or `ENTRYPOINT`, introduced in lecture, I keep trying to understand more about Dockerfile.
