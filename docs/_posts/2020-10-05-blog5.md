## Dockerfile Continue...

First time I submitted this assignment, I didn't have `CMD` command in my Dockerfile to run apache2 automatically because I could not figure out how to make it works.  
However, I learned it from Oct 3rd Saturday class (yup, due was extended), so I have added it and resubmitted even thought it was optional. (Because I wanted have it! lol)

Dockerfile reference for CMD
- [docker docs -CMD-](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd)

According to this site,
The CMD instruction has three forms:
  - `CMD ["executable","param1","param2"] (exec form, this is the preferred form)`
  - `CMD ["param1","param2"] (as default parameters to ENTRYPOINT)`
  - `CMD command param1 param2 (shell form)`  

  So, I picked first form to try.
  ```
  CMD ["apachectl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
  ```
Description of the command:
1. "apachectl"
  - "apachectl" or "apache2ctl" whichever, it still refers same thing.
2. "-D"
  - Option -D, --default: reset all options to their default values
3. "FOREGROUND"
  - To run apache2 in foreground  
  Reference link [Background vs. Foreground Processes](https://deninet.com/blog/2015/08/16/docker-scratch-part-3-entrypoints-and-ports)

  I was able to build the image with no error, but in the container, apache2 wasn't running.  
  I tried second and third form, but it was same result.  
  
  And that was because...

When you run a container in Docker, you gonna run  
`$ docker exec -it <name of container> bash` for existing container  
or  
`$ docker run -it -p 8080:80 --name <name of container> <name of image> bash`   
for new container

Using `CMD` is to provide defaults for the container when it starts.  
In order to let CMD overwrite the action, you would not put `bash` or `bin/bash` at the end of above commands.  

When I run the container there is no prompt, it just warns because I didn't set server's name

* If you use CMD in shell mode, the prompt shows up.

I opened browser to go to 192.168.99.100:8080, then affinity web site comes up.

## Done!
Now, lab2 is officially done, and on next lab I am going to do same thing but using ansible.
