## iPhone 12 is released!!!
Finally iPhone 12 comes out! I have used iPhone 6s Plus for 5yrs, so it's time to get new phone.  
I was going to get iPhone 11 when it came out, but I didn't because it was not compatible with 5G.  
I am sure I am gonna use the new phone for several years if it doesn't have any problem.  So, it should be compatible with 5G.  
Next question would be which I'm gonna buy 12 pro or regular 12....  
I like blue, and both blue color look good... （○￣ ～ ￣○；）umm  


## Anyway, Ansible
On Lab3, we gonna create ansible playbook to do same thing as we did on Lab1, Lab2.
  - [What is Ansible?](https://opensource.com/resources/what-ansible)  

In the class demonstration, it is always using AWS instances, but I just wanted to try it in Docker container as Lab3 pdf file shows so that I can focus on creating Ansible playbook.

Just following the instruction...  

Start a new container
```
$ docker run –it -p 8080:80 ubuntu:18.04 /bin/bash
```

Run apt update and install ansible inside the container
```
$ apt update && apt install -y ansible
```

Make a directory to work from:  
```
$ mkdir -p /home/ansible ; cd /home/ansible
```


## White space matter

First, I made a sample ansible to see what gonna happen.
```
---
  - hosts: 127.0.0.1
    connection:  localhost

    tasks:
      - name: Install required packages
        apt:
          name:
            - curl
            - apache2
            - zip
          state: present
```

Actually ↑ this is final version of the sample, so it looks good.  
But first time I tried, I got a lot of syntax errors that mostly due to spaces

![synError1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/96195227-1795a880-0f01-11eb-9c1a-5841450e0ffa.png){:height="100px" width="300px"}

fixed it, and  
![synError2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/96195228-1795a880-0f01-11eb-99a8-59df984ed985.png){:height="100px" width="300px"}

Got this again!!!  
![synError3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/96195229-182e3f00-0f01-11eb-8172-170904b8859a.png){:height="100px" width="300px"}  

Finally, it went good, I saw all packages had been installed, but I am already tired for making only a sample file lol     


### Where is Git Bash?  
By the way, I usually use atom editor to write this blog posts.  
I also open Git Bash on atom to check the post in local and commit, but it suddenly stopped opening Git Bash, not only it but open any terminal (default is Powershell).  
I was trying several things check the setting of the package, rebooting it, so on...  
And I noticed they just released new version of atom (1.52.0) on Oct 13th and my setting was to download update automatically.  
So, I uninstalled atom and installed it with old version (1.50.0, just in case), then unchecked auto-update, now it opens a terminal without any problem.  
I don't really know what did it cause, but anyway it is fixed.  


I will continue Ansible Playbook on next blog because I have to submit this blog now and I still have another week to finish this assignment.
