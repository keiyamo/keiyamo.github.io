## Ansible Playbook  
Now, I got used to how to control spaces in ansible playbook, so I listed required packages in ansible playlist.  Then, I realized I don't need to include `apt-get upgrade` or `apt-get update` like I did in Dockerfile because by the time running this playbook, those processes should have been completed.  
So, I thought "Maybe I can create the Dockerfile to configure the prerequisites!". I asked professor about that, and she said it gonna be good practice. Actually I thought "Oh I already know how to write the Dockerfile! hehe", but later I realize I was wrong....


Anyway, installing packages part is nothing complicated.  
What I needed to do more are:
- clone affinity
- change ownership of files inside affinity
- create symbolic link
- Edit conf files
- install composer packages
- install composer


First, I run the command to clone affinity as
```
git:
  repo: https://github.com/csuntechlab/affinity.git
  dest: /var/www/html
  ```

  However, I got error it says
  `'/var/www/html' already exists and is not empty`  
  I thought `dest:` was like working directory, but it seems it is not.   
  So, I changed to `dest: /var/www/html/affinity`, then it works.
  BTW, it also works if you create `affinity` directory before the `git` command. Actually this process was the first I tried, but I omit it because the configuration file is always better to be simple.

### Oh typo! lol  
  Next one is changing ownership, I refer this [example](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/file_module.html#examples) from [ansible module pages](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.8/modules/modules_by_category.html)  
  But I kept getting errors, and I had no idea what was wrong, and I finally realized...

  well.... there is something....

  Oops, I typed `www-date` instead of `www-data`!  


### Symbolic link
  Creating symboliclink, this one took long time to me to figure out how I make it works.  
  I refer same [website](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/file_module.html#examples)

  What took me so long to figure out was because I was confused as `src` was `/var/www/html/public` and `dest` was `/var/www/html/affinity/public` but it was opposite.  
  Now it makes sense that if I focused the mechanism of symbolic link which is original in this case.
  And each individual error I got was not really clear to reach out the solution, but after I got series of errors, I finally began to doubt if the `src` and `dest` were correct.   

  ![Error_symboliclink](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/96651067-e1816b80-12e8-11eb-9757-3e32738d034e.png){:height="100px" width="300px"} src file does not exist...
  ![Error_symboliclink2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/96651069-e2b29880-12e8-11eb-84f8-a73bb083c0b6.png){:height="100px" width="300px"} refusing to convert between directory and link...  
  ![Error_symboliclink3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/96651072-e2b29880-12e8-11eb-9b99-e19aa2947d42.png){:height="100px" width="300px"} because the directory is not empty??? wait...

### Copy the files
  Every time I think "oh it is not big deal", it always did not go easy.  
  So, never underestimate anything, ever! (I am sure I still will do lol)  

  Anyway, I was just trying to copy out original conf file `000-default.conf` and `apache2.conf` to edit.
  So, run
  ```
  $ docker cp [container id]:[file path]
```
But I got an error  
![copyError](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/96652722-56a27000-12ec-11eb-8b73-7944f1148fc4.png){:height="100px" width="300px"}  

I didn't really remember if I put destination path the last time when I used `cp` command.  
I added the dest path as I saved it in my pc, but it doesn't work either.   

Then my professor told me I should add `.` at the end to copy out the file into current directory.  
I didn't remember if I did this the last time, but I suppose I did.  

Since I introduced the `cp` command in my [Blog 4](/2020-09-30-Blog4/#copy-out-files), I updated the post to provide right information.


Okay, now I copied out files, edited, and saved those in same directory with `yml` file.

### Using curl command  
  Next one is installing composer packages. In Lab1 and Lab2, I used `curl` command to do that.  
  However, I was not sure how to use curl command in ansible playbook, then I found this [composer module examples](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/modules/composer_module.html#examples)  

  Make a long story short, I was not able to figure out how to use those examples to install composer packages, so I asked professor in the class, then one of classmates suggested to use `Shell` module.  
  It works!!
```
- name: Install composer pkgs
  shell: curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
  ```

  [`Shell` module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.8/modules/shell_module.html#shell-module) seems very useful and easy to put commands without thinking about ansible playbook syntax.  

  And I installed composer, so I finished everything needs to show affinity website in local!

  **Ta-da!**  
    ![WebService](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/93693208-a570a600-fab1-11ea-809d-de0abaf2f96c.png){:height="200px" width="350px"}

  Now I can submit this lab, but actually I told Lisa I'm gonna attach the Dockerfile which has the configuration to run ansible-playbook. I thought it is very simple task, but I kinda regret that I said so.

  Setting up installing `ansible` in Dockerfile is not easy. It is not just `RUN apt-get install ansible` but it is python dependency.  
  If you install `ansible` in the container, you just run `apt install ansible` then python is coming together, but in Dockerfile, it seems you need different approach.  

  I am trying to figure out. I will talk about this on next week's blog because this lab's due is this Friday, Oct 23rd.
