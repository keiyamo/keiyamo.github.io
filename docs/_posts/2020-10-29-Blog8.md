### How it ends

Let me just quickly tell you how I did to install ansible in Dockerfile.  
```
RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
RUN apt-get install -y vim \
    ansible
```

That's it!  
I tried this very first time, but I got an error, so I thought there should be another way to do.  
I could not find another way, and tried again then it works.... yeah it works after all!  

## Terraform
Now let me talk a little about `Terraform`.  
Terraform is an open-source tool, created by HashiCorp.  
We can set up/ config an infrastructure in cloud service by coding. It is infrastructure as code.  
- [Introduction to Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html)   
- [Terraform Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html)

These are main cloud services to use Terraform.
- AWS - Amazon Web services
- GCP - Google Cloud Platform
- Microsoft Azure

In our class, we use AWS. AWS offers AWS Educate service that provides students or educators to access to AWS contents, training, and credit that you can use with your AWS account to try beyond their free tier services.

I really like that many US companies provide a lot of privileges for student.  
For example, I got discount from Microsoft when I bought my PC, surface pro (4, and 7), Amazon Prime Student you can be prime member with almost half amount of regular membership price, and you can subscribe Apple music, now with Apple TV (at October 2020) 6 months free trial and then half monthly fee up to 48 months, or many other discounts.


## Let's start AWS
To use Terraform, let's set up AWS first.
I created AWS account with my personal email account because I didn't know about AWS educate.
But I was able to attach my AWS educate credit ($100) to my account later.  

There are three types of platform to operate AWS  
- AWS Management Console
  - GUI interface that you can access from web browser. There is [app](https://aws.amazon.com/console/mobile/) for mobile too
- AWS Command Line interface (AWS CLI)
  - Command Line Interface, using command to control multiple AWS services
- Software Development Kits (SDK)
  - Using your application with Application Program Interface (API) to use your platform  

I use Management Console for now. It is good for AWS newbie.

The email address you used to sign up for AWS, is Root user account.  
Choose `Root user` to [sign in](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?nc2=h_ct&src=header-signin).  
![signIn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/97677547-a7823900-1a4f-11eb-96c3-09bcca956026.png){:height="300px" width="250px"}

## Identity and Access Management
First thing you need to do at AWS is to create an IAM user.  
IAM is `Identity and Access Management` service that you can manage who can access what resources in AWS.   
Although you might be the only one who access your AWS for practice, it'd be better to use IAM user account to sign in.  
AWS strongly recommend you to use IAM user account to access to AWS for daily use because AWS account root user has **full** access to all resources in AWS, so it should not be used for day-to-day interactions.  
And it is good practice to set up permission, policy, or role for the IAM user.



At AWS Management Console, type `IAM` to go to IAM dashboard  
![Services](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/97677546-a7823900-1a4f-11eb-9106-4f53883ee83c.png){:height="300px" width="300px"}


Click either `Users` on navigation pane or on dashboard `Users: 0`(if you don't have any)
![IAMDashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/97677543-a6510c00-1a4f-11eb-84dc-db9ab4ff700d.png){:height="200px" width="450px"}


Then, click `Add user`  
![AddUser](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/97677549-a81acf80-1a4f-11eb-8ba2-c1b4aa7faca8.png){:height="200px" width="450px"}


Next you follow each step to set permission for the user or to add to a group if you want.  
- Set user details
  - Enter new username
- Select AWS access type
  - I checked both Access type `Programmatic access` and `AWS Management Console access`
- Set permissions
  - I added this user to a group, named `Admin` and attached AdministratorAccess policy (You can do this later)  
- Add tags
  - This is like meta data that can include user information. I skipped this
- Review
  - To verify the information is correct  

Once you clicked `Create user`, it displays Username, Access key ID, and Secret access key (as default, it is hidden).
You can download csv file with that information if you want.

Now you gonna use the username and password to sign in AWS console for next time.
