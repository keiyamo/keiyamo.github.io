## EC2 -Elastic Compute Cloud-
Amazon EC2 service provides scalable virtual compute environment, which is known as `instance`  
Common uses for EC2 instances are:
- Application server
- Web server
- Database server
- Mail server    
so on...

For senior project Lab4, I am going to create an EC2 instance to use it as a web server.   

As I mentioned at the end of [previous blog](/2020-10-29-Blog8/), I am using IAM user account to login AWS.  
![IAMsignin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/98315740-cfacf300-1f8d-11eb-98c3-1ad3454c9d9a.png){:height="260px" width="300px"}  

I recommend you to keep the URL which you can get from IAM dashboard, or better to remember 12 digits Account ID  

### Let's create an EC2 instance
In AWS management console, choose the service `EC2`  
![ManageConsole](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/98316341-151df000-1f8f-11eb-90f1-3c8df88c95da.png){:height="260px" width="300px"}

On EC2 dashboard:
1. Click Instances - Instances on the left navigation pane
2. Click `Launch Instances` at the right top  
3. Choose AMI(Amazon Machine Image), the operation system you want to use in the instance
  - I choose Ubuntu server 20.04 because I am getting used to
4. Choose an instance type
  - default is `t2.micro`, so I chose it as is
5. Configure instance details
  - for this time, I just leave everything as default  
  BTW, you can customize the instance at all the way bottom `Advanced Details` `User data`, I will talk about this later, maybe next post.  
6. Add storage
  - default size is 8GB, leave it as is
7. Add tags
 - This is like meta data that you can add a tag as description, I added tag as `cit480-keiyamo-lab4`, but it is not necessary.
8. Configure security group
  - I chose an existing security group, `default` one, but it was mistake. Even though it says it allows all traffic, I had to add inbound rules for ssh and http later. So, don't be a lazy, just create new one! ;)
9. Review and Launch!
  - review if all config is collect, then click `Launch`
10. Select key pair
  - If you don't have any existing key pair, create and download it to your local machine from where you would make ssh connection. I named it `cit480_lab4`. It is automatically created as a .pem file.
11. It may take a few minutes the instance is ready to connect.  

### Access the instance via SSH
I am a Windows user, and my OS is Windows 10 home ver 1909 (Yes I haven't update to the latest ver 20H2, released Oct 2020), and now SSH client is a part of Windows 10, but it is still an "optional feature", so you need to add it unless you want to use third party SSH client such as [PuTTy](https://www.putty.org/), or [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)

Here is how to add ssh feature in Windows 10
- Go to Setting -> Apps -> Apps & features  
![appsFeature](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ximg_5a396fd91eaab.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.IftDL7cHCO.png){:height="200px" width="400px"}
- Click `Add a feature`, then choose "OpenSSH Client" to install
![addFeature](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ximg_5a39705c49706.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic._DBJCg2JIT.png){:height="200px" width="400px"}

I used Powershell to create ssh connection to the Instance  
This is the command to make ssh connection
```
$ ssh -i <path to key> <user>@<hostname/IP>
```
So, in my case,
```
PS C:\Users\yamam> ssh -i C:\Users\yamam\Downloads\cit480_lab4.pem ubuntu@52.xx.xxx.xx
```
The IP address, you can find at `Instance Details`  
FYI, default user name for each AMI is different, find your AMI default user name [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.html#TroubleshootingInstancesCommonCauses)  

After you connected to the instance, set up as usual
```
$ sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
```
```
$ sudo apt install apache2 -y
```
<span style="color:blue">** This set up you can config in advance at `Advanced Details` `User data` as I mentioned above</span>  

After you start `apache2`, open a browser with your instance IP address.  
It should open apache default page.

For our lab4, I changed index.html under `/var/www/html` to show like this  
![Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/98322728-00485900-1f9d-11eb-8d8d-663aceabc60c.png){:height="150px" width="400px"}  
<span style="color:blue">** btw, my instance no longer use this IP address once I terminate (or just stop) the instance (There is still tiny chance I would get same address someday tho, lol)</span>

### Done!
I also created a S3 bucket and copied the index.html into it for the lab assignment.  
I may talk about it next time  

Don't forget to terminate the instance and delete the s3 bucket after you finished!  
It could cost you even though it is not that much.
