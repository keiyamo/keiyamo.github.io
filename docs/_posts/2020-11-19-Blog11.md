## AWS CLI
AWS CLI is AWS Command Line Interface tool that is used to operate AWS services using commands from your command-line shell.  
I am a Windows' user. On Windows, Windows command prompt or Powershell would be major choices of CLI. I personally prefer Powershell, so I will install AWS CLI on it.   

Right now, AWS CLI is available in two versions,  
- Version 1.x: the previous version. It still available for backwards compatibility  
- Version 2.x: the latest version (at Nov, 2020). Some features introduced in ver2 are not backported to ver1  
*There are some breaking changes from ver1 that might require you to change the scripts.*


## Installing AWS CLI version 2
To follow [the instruction on AWS site](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-windows.html)

You are required to have:
- A 64-bit version of Windows XP or later
- Admin rights to install a software  

Okay, I passed both :)

[The site](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-windows.html#cliv2-windows-install) introduces two ways of installation.  
(Once hit the link, it starts downloading the installer)
- Installing `the latest` version  
  - [https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi)
- Installing `the specific` minor version  
  - For example, if you want to install the version `2.0.30`, then you add the ver # at the end of the link, like `AWSCLIV2-2.0.30.msi` for this case.  
  You can find list of versions on [Github](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/blob/v2/CHANGELOG.rst)

To confirm if it is installed properly, open `PowerShell` and run `aws --version`  
![awsVersion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/99864052-12f28e80-2b56-11eb-9768-c9ee4c508c4d.png){:height="40px" width="400px"}
