## Fall 2020 is almost over!
OMG, time flies! the first half senior design class is about to end.  
I feel it's been so fast while I learned a lot from this class!!  

Ironically, I should get back to see how to set up jekyll website on Github because I upgraded my PC from Windows 10 home edition to pro edition the other day.  
I should have done this earlier because it makes much easier to do some job like run Docker container.  
And another reason I think I really SHOULD HAVE DONE this earlier is....
I need to set up many things to do class assignments (including this blog project)  

Well, let me talk about how to upgrade Windows 10 home to pro


### Upgrade to Windows pro edition
Not long after the class started, I realized it is better to have Windows 10 pro edition to do those class assignments smoothly, especially when we start using Docker.  
As I mentioned it in [Blog 2](/2020-09-18-Blog2/), I needed to use `Docker Toolbox` instead of `Docker Desktop` due to system requirement (and some my preference).  

Anyway, I found the Windows 10 pro for $29.99 on [softwarecodespro.com](https://softwarecodespro.com/)  
There are some shady sites that selling win pro same price range, but I heard about this site from my friend, so I thought it is trustworthy.  

Now, I got the product key of win pro, then I open **Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Activation**,    
![changeProductKey](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/101229491-60dabc80-3655-11eb-8c7c-f372ff3afacb.png){:height="100px" width="300px"}   
**Click** `Change product key`  

![enterProductKey](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/101229672-39382400-3656-11eb-8aaf-333534bd4c0c.png){:height="120px" width="300px"}
**Enter** `product key`    

Basically that is it!! (if everything goes well)

### Of course there are always some errors....
But you know me that I always get some errors lol (not my preference tho)  

First, I could not activate the product key, then what naturally comes up in my mind was "Is  this product key legit?"  
I contacted to the seller, meanwhile I googled about the error code `0x803fa067` I got, and there is a [site](https://appuals.com/fix-windows-10-activation-error-0x803fa067/) that has an exact answer I looked for.  
Basically the site suggests to turn off network connection when activating the product key, so I did, and it activated!!  
This is really interesting because that means win pro program was already in my pc? The product key is just to wake up the program?? very interesting. (I should learn more about OS system anyway)  

Anyway, unfortunately it is not yet happily ever after....   

### What is my "Organization"???  
Well, even though the activation process went "successfully" and it shows "Window 10 pro", I still see this warning on my Setting page  
![ActivateError](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/101230170-a9e04000-3658-11eb-93a3-d322a7a4a73b.png){:height="250px" width="300px"}   
Thus, I contacted the seller again, then they gave me another product key and they said "It's 100% guarantee" (what that means? so what was the first one then?)   
Anyway, I tried the new product key with same process (no internet connection) and it works and there is no warning sign.  BUT NOT CONGRATS YET!!!

I found out this saying on some setting pages  
![organizationError](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/101230465-49ea9900-365a-11eb-8a50-301273dd77d4.png){:height="120px" width="300px"}   

What is "your organization"? this is my personal laptop.   
And I found out many people have same complaints.  
I tried some solutions I found at websites, but none of them worked.  
By now, I realized I didn't update the latest version of windows before I upgrade to win pro which supposed to be done. (I did the latest update, but my version was still 1909 while 202H is the latest version of Windows)  

So make a long story short, I contacted Microsoft tech and she remotely accessed my pc via `Quick Assist`(this is way better than remote desktop!!), then I had to sweep out the pc to install the latest version's win pro.   
I occasionally backed up my data, so data is fine, but some apps are gone that is why I need to set up again.  
Because of that, I am kinda behind of lab5 which is due on coming Tuesday(12/8), but I believe I can handle it (hopefully, lol).


## Wrap up
Well, again I have learned a lot on this semester.  
I like this class reminded me many I learned in past CIT/IS classes which I really didn't know how I use in practical situation.   
Now second half of senior design class will come and it is going to be more practical than this semester.   
I am scared and excited same time, I hope it is going to be fun!!!
