## Spring 2021 Began!
It has been two weeks since new semester started.   
Although I changed class schedule from Tue/Thu to Sat for this senior design class, professor is same and most students are already familiar to me.  
This semester we will mainly focus on Group Project (and this Blog project).  
It is still vague what we are going to do, but I am already overwhelmed and excited same time.  

### Coding v Scripting
One of the reasons I am scared of Senior Design Project is because I am not good for coding.  
I assume we need coding for the project either much or less. That evokes me the traumatizing comp182...   
I like scripting, and occasionally I am asked what the difference between those.  
In this case, I categorize coding is **Programming** which is to create a program.   
Scripting is that to control the program, it is more like **Operating** to me. Different approach of interface.

Although I am not good for coding, I am still fascinated when my code work in a way I expected. So, I like learning coding for fun (but not in class...).  
I have learned some languages at school, like
- C++
- Java
- Assembly  
so on.....   


I also learned only surface of some other languages in cit270 like Pearl, Python, or PHP....  
Among those languages, I got interested in Python. Python is really intuitive language and it is one of the most popular languages that many people wanted to learn.  
I have been watching a YouTube video, Python tutorial.  

[![Python Tutorial](http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/_uQrJ0TkZlc/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc?t=1){:target="_blank"}

Although I haven't finished the video, that is 6-hours long, this is really good video.  
If you want to reinforce your fundamental knowledge of Python, it's highly recommended.   

The tutorial occasionally gives me practice exercises.  Then, I can stop the video to try the exercise, and once I start the video, he gives the practical solution.  
At many times my coding is not exactly same to his coding, but it is okay that as long as the code works. And I still learn a lot from his coding how to write the code simple and effectively.  

### Dictionary  -video [here](https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc?t=8311){:target="_blank"}
Python has a function called **Dictionary**. It is a type of database, you can use it like a personal dictionary that you store key values against certain words, then it automatically call the associate value once the code runs.  
For example...  
```
digits_mapping = {
    "1": "One",
    "2": "Two",
    "3": "Three",
    "4": "Four"
}

print(digits_mapping["2"])
```
Then, it returns
```
Two
```

Using this function, the video introduce how to create **Emoji Convertor**  
like  
```
>I am happy
I am üòÉ
```
Though this is not exactly same example the video [shows](https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc?t=8791){:target="_blank"}, I did this way.  
My code is like
```
message = input(">")
words = message.split(" ")
expression = {
    "love": "‚ù§Ô∏è",
    "happy": "üòÉ",
    "sad": "üò¢"
}
output = ""
for wor in words:
    output += expression.get(wor, wor) + " "
print(output)
```
It works, but one thing I still don't know why it happened is...
```
>I love you
I ‚ù§Ô∏è you
```
What? wait a minute.....

This is exactly I see it on VS code  
![result](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/108141648-fabcdd80-7078-11eb-92db-c717c6e40bda.png){:height="50px" width="350px"}  
What I wanted to say is **no space after icon**. It only happened after **heart** icon.  
However, now if I copy and paste the result from VS code to here, it shows normal......ummm interesting....


Well, now I gonna say that there are many things confuse me during learning new staffs.   
I assume the process might give some lessons to me, hopefully.   

Anyway, new semester started and I will get into a lot of unknown, that should be fun!!!
