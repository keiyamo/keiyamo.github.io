BTW, today is my birthdayðŸŽ‚, yay!

## Task Breakdown
Our group set up weekly zoom group meeting on every Saturday, and what we did in the group meeting (3/6) are:
- Created EC2 instance (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS) and run
- Installed  Apache2 in the instance
- Created VPC and subnetting as they are required
  - 3 public subnets in different AZ with minimum 1024 available IP address
  - 3 Private subnets in different AZ with minimum 4096 available IP address
- Got Elastic IP address AWS

We tried to associate the Elastic IP to our instance, but somehow I got errors (first, it was permission error, but after the root user tried same thing it said the Elastic IP address is already associated to.....somewhere(where?!))  

Anyway, therefore I decided (yeah, I am the leader of project 0) to break down tasks we do until next group meeting.  
- Solving Elastic IP address association issue
- Set up Route 53 (We already bought our domain terabytecit.com)
- Generate TLS certification
- Write Ansible Playbook
It is not necessarily to finish by one member, but just assigned to be responsible for each task.

I have been assigned the TLS certificate task.  

### Generate TLS Certificate
- Go to [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
  To enable HTTPS on your website, you need to get a certificate (a type of file) from a Certificate Authority (CA). Letâ€™s Encrypt is a CA. In order to get a certificate for your websiteâ€™s domain from Letâ€™s Encrypt, you have to demonstrate control over the domain.   
- Use [ACEM protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555)
- There are two ways to setup
  - With `Shell` - we choose this way
    - Use [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) ACME client.
  - Without `Shell`

`Requirement to use Certbot`  
![Certbot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/110901905-e2c42c80-82b9-11eb-86cd-38a5e7f97234.png){:height="200px" width="400px"}

Since our domain is not set up to our web server yet, I can't start this process yet.  
Meanwhile, I am looking at the instruction on the `Certbot` website ->[here](https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntubionic-apache)  
And on the other hand, I found this [instruction](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/SSL-on-amazon-linux-ami.html#ssl-enable-alami) at AWS documentation. Those are different.

If I want to get free certificate, it's be better to follow the process on Certbot site because the instruction because the site offers free certification and AWS site instruction is general.   
I believe if you paid for the certificate, it would be more secure, but it is a school assignment and there are no credential information we need to protect, so we stay on free certificate.  

I will keep posting about the process.  
And I will join some AWS Online Tech Talk events next week and the week after, it is exciting!!!
