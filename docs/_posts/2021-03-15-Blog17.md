## Associate Elastic IP address
After I talked about TLS certificate at [Blog16](/2021-03-12-Blog16/), it is a little bit backward, but I would like to talk about setting of Elastic IP address to an ec2 instance.  

After we created EC2 instances, we tried to associate our Elastic IP address to our instances.  
However, we got errors that we can't associate ELIP to the instance.  
![EIPassociate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/111235273-8c066d80-85ad-11eb-8bec-26cc2a3fd8f1.png){: height="240px" width="400px"}  
First, I checked "Allow this Elastic IP address..." at the bottom, and I got permission error, then I unchecked it, it said the Elastic IP address is already an association ID which we had no idea where it was.(Later we figured out tho)   

Since we had no idea how to fix it, we decided to start over the process like creating EC2 instances or so on.  


But next, when we created a new EC2 instance, public IP address and Public DNS were blank on the EC2 instance detail.  
- The instance is attached to our vpcID (terabyte0: vpc-06494824e5c643e07) which we already created subnets as required by project0.
- We set the instance into public subnets

The reason we didn't get public IP address for the instance was `Auto-assign public IPv4 address` was set ``"No"`` for the subnets we created. (defaul VPC subnet setting was "Yes")
We didn't see the option when we created subnets, but we are able to change it from `Action`.  
![ModifyAutoAssignIP](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/111237498-72b3f000-85b2-11eb-9f5b-35321c406279.png){: height="180px" width="150px"}  

Then, we are able to associate Elastic IP address to the new instance, then the detail shows our ELIP as `Public IP address`.  

We tried to delete original ELIP which we were not able to associate to instances because we don't need it anymore and it is not free to hold, but on the action "Release Elastic IP address" was greyed out that we can't release.   
![releaseELIP](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/111237978-62e8db80-85b3-11eb-85e0-69ee8be3487f.png){: height="160px" width="160px"}

We need to disassociate the address otherwise it keeps charging it, but we didn't know where it'd be connecting to.  
Make long story short, a group member found that it was connected to a NAT gateway, so we deleted the gateway to disassociate and release it. (We still don't know why it was connected to the NAT gateway thoðŸ™„)   
And I realized we didn't need to create own vpc, we could have used the default vpc to do this task.  
If we used the default one, we would've not faced this issue because `Auto-assign public IPv4` was already `yes` on the default vpc, but we learned something anyway, that's good after all :)
