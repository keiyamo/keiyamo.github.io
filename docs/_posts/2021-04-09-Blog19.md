## Terraform
Though I did an assignment of Terraform in last semester, I need to refresh my memory to do some tasks of Senior Design alternate project 1.  

At the last group meeting, we break down some tasks to assign each group member, and I am assigned to do terraform tasks.
- IAM (users, groups, policies, etc)
- VPC (subnets, route tables, Internet Gateways, NAT instances, etc)  

I recall I created tf file to create an ec2 instance and create a s3 bucket.  
And Lisa showed a couple of demos that mostly cover what need to be done for the lab, so it wasn't hard at all.  
I should confess because the lab was easy, so I didn't really remember about terraform and now I need to review.  

Here, I little bit talked about what Terraform is -> [Blog 8](/2020-10-29-Blog8/)   

Terraform can use at several different cloud providers, and I would like to use it on AWS.
- This is Terraform tutorials which focus on AWS
  [Terraform Get Started - AWS](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/aws-get-started)  

### Declare Provider
At the first of tf file, I need to declare what provider I use.  I use AWS, so I need to put this at top.  
```
provider "aws" {
  profile = "default"
  region  = "us-west-2"
}
```
`profile` is what AWS account I want to access to run this tf file.  
For example, I have my own aws account and my group aws IAM user account.  
`default` would be my own aws account.  Since I named my group IAM user credentials as "Terabyte1" in credentials file at /.aws, thus if I want to run tf file on my group IAM user, it should be `profile = "Terabyte1"`   
I want to test on my own aws account, so I leave it `default` right now.  

What follow after are what I need to do, so in this case I need to create IAM users, IAM roles, and policies for first task.  

Here is registry page that I can find resource/module of terraform for AWS
- [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs)

If you want to find resource to create IAM user, you can search by keyword and find the example usage.  
![TerraRegistry](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/114258306-92a0be80-997a-11eb-99d3-03c9bf03a3f3.png){:height="250px" width="375px"}


This is `Example Usage` from [Resource: aws_iam_user](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/iam_user)
```
resource "aws_iam_user" "lb" {
  name = "loadbalancer"
  path = "/system/"

  tags = {
    tag-key = "tag-value"
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_access_key" "lb" {
  user = aws_iam_user.lb.name
}

resource "aws_iam_user_policy" "lb_ro" {
  name = "test"
  user = aws_iam_user.lb.name

  policy = <<EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "ec2:Describe*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
}
```  

I can just copy and paste this to my tf file and edit wherever I need (ie. name, tags)    
And I am adding for [aws_iam_role](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/iam_role) and [aws_iam_policy](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/iam_policy).  


The commands I need to run are:  
- `terraform init` to initialize a working directory.
- `terraform plan` to create an execute plan.
- `terraform apply` to execute the configulation on tf file.

A command to destroy all created by terraform is:
- `terraform destroy`  

It's fine for IAM user, but the service, I just spin up, cost, it's better to destroy after you tested.
