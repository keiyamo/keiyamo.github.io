## Terraform for VPC Set up  
To write down VPC network on terraform, I need to understand whole view that what need to place where and how they are associating.  
This is a sample diagram that I tried to create
![sampleVPCImage](https://d2i5xfuhwts0l0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-07-at-15.43.57.png)

To make connection to private subnet, it needs a NAT[Network Address Transation] device.  
There are [two ways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat.html) for NAT feature in AWS  
- NAT instance - [aws docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html)
- NAT gateway - [aws docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html)


Among those, AWS recommends `NAT Gateway` because...
- They provided availability and bandwidth over `NAT instances`   
- The `NAT Gateway` service is also a managed service by AWS that does not require you administration efforts.  
**In addition,**  
- NAT AMI is built on the last version of Amazon Linux, 2018.03 which reached the end of standard support on <span style="color:red">December 31, 2020.</span> (You still can use the AMI or create your own NAT AMI though)   


Therefore, I decided to use NAT Gateway

To create NAT gateway,  
```
# NAT gateway
resource "aws_nat_gateway" "nat_gateway" {

  // elastic ip attaches to nat gateway
  allocation_id = aws_eip.elastic_ip.id   
  // the subnet in which this nat gateway locate     
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public-subnet1.id 

  tags = {
    Name = "nat-gateway"
  }
}
```

and route table  
```
# route table for NAT gateway
resource "aws_route_table" "nat_route" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.terabyte1.id

  route {
    cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    gateway_id = aws_nat_gateway.nat_gateway.id
  }
  

  tags = {
    Name = "NAT-route-table"
  }
}
```

Route table association to IGW route table and NAT route table
```
# associate route table to public subnet
resource "aws_route_table_association" "routetable_to_public_subnet1" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.public-subnet1.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.IG_route.id
}
```
I set this resource five times more for two other public subnets and other three are to associate to nat route table so that I can access to private subnet.  


I installed apache server into the instance in private subnet via bastion host in public subet (I may talk about this in later blog) and run apache.  
I expected to be able to see apache default website if I put the elastic ip address which attached to NAT gateway, but I can't.  So, I am still working on it, and hoping I can write down how to solve it in next blog.
