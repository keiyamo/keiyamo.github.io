### Load balancer
To answer for the question I had at the end of [last blog](/2021-04-16-Blog20/) (why I can't access the web server with the NAT gateway IP address), that is because I needed `Load balancer`.   
Once load balancer is created, an A record is given, like this format:  
`terabyte-elb-1229719725.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/`  
Putting the A record to the browser address bar, I was able to see web pages in the web server.  

However, then another question comes up, how we can make our domain point to the A record.  
Our group's domain is stil registered under [NameCheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/) due to ICANN's rule that we can't transfer the domain in 60 days after purchase.  
I can manage A record on the DNS service of NameCheap.com, but they expect A record should be IP address format, xx.xx.xx.xx, not the format AWS provides. So, we could not change.   

### Route53 Host zone
I assumed we can't use Route 53 unless we trasfer the domain to AWS, but it was wrong.  

One of my classmates once mentioned about hosted zone, and it was the solution for that.  
First, I found this video "**How to Use GoDaddy Domains with AWS Route 53 Hosted Zones**"
[![AttachDomain](http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/zFuluVTsF14/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFuluVTsF140)

Our domain is from NameCheap.com not GoDaddy, but basic process is same.  

First, you need to create a hosted zone on Route 53.  
I refer AWS doc page [Making Route 53 the DNS service for an inactive domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/migrate-dns-domain-inactive.html#migrate-dns-get-zone-file-domain-inactive) because our domain has no traffic.   

1. Get your current DNS configuration from curernt DNS service provider 
2. Create a hosted zone on AWS Route 53
3. Create record on AWS Route 53
4. Update the domain registration to use Amazon Route 53

For Step 1, since NameCheap.com also provides DNS service for their user, I logged in their page to see current DNS setting.  

On AWS page, I created hosted zone and see their name server 
![hostedZone](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/115947792-fb119480-a47e-11eb-864f-d8a2039e508c.png){:height="200px" width="500px"}  
Then, those name server names are given  

I created a record to add `www.terabytecit.com` point to the load balancer


![Arecord](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/115947588-8ab64380-a47d-11eb-80ce-9e69404faee0.png){:height="250px" width="500px"}   

After that, I go NameCheap.com to change name servers information as given on AWS Route 53  


**Ta-da!**  
![browser](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69828773/115947781-ea611e80-a47e-11eb-908a-62890a2883b4.png){:height="200px" width="450px"} 

This only works when I enter `www.terabytecit.com`, but if I enter only `terabytecit.com`, it doesn't work because I entered subdomain `www` on record of hosted zone.  
I also created another A record with no subdomain as `terabytecit.com`, and now it works.  
 

Our group is about to transfer our domain to AWS since 60 days period will end soon.  
Then whole process would be different, and we also need to create terraform file for Route 53 setting, but that was good to learn how hosted zone work for another registra domain.  

Btw, I will destroy whole setting on AWS soon because I don't want to be charged for some setting.
