## Almost Over!!!
This is the second last blog for Senior Design Class.  
I can't believe I am going to graduate in three weeks.  
This past year is extraordinary circumstance for everybody.  
I wish I was in campus in my last year of school, but same time that was good it was not my first or second year in school.  
I already knew some people in my major class. We've been in same class in past.
Although I can't see other's face (I have never seen anybody turning camera on in CIT/COMP classes, lol), I still recognize many names in the class that makes me comfortable to be there.  

Our senior design project is about to wrap up.  
Now we are in Project 2 phase.  

## Cost Saving 
Project 2 main target is saving cost.
One of benefits of using cloud service is saving cost, and AWS has many services to support it.  

In Project 2, we are using 
- Spot Instance
- Serverless Task (Lambda Function)
- Monitoring 

### Spot Instance   
[AWS doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html)  
A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts, you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly.

The following concepts of Spot Instance we should know [for detail ->](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html#spot-features)
- Spot capacity pool
- Spot price
- Spot Instance request
- EC2 instance rebalance recommendation
- Spot instance interruption 

Spot instance is you can use EC2 instance in `Spot capacity pool` as long as your setting maximum price is higher than `Spot Price`.  
That could be lower price than on-demand instance.   
However, `Spot price` is occasionally changing, and if it becomes higher than your setting maximum price, the instance is going to be interrupted.  

`EC2 instance rebalance recommendation` notifies you once the instance is in risk of being interrupted.  
This signal gives you the opportunity to proactively rebalance your workloads across existing or new Spot Instances without having to wait for the two-minute Spot Instance interruption notice.  

When the Spot price exceeds the maximum price for your request, you would receive `Spot Instance interruption`, which gives the instance a two-minute warning before it is interrupted.  

Spot instance is cost-effective choice, but it should be concerned the risk of terminating/hibernating the instances.

### Serverless Task -Lambda-   
[AWS doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html)    
Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.  
With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service.  

For this project, we will use `Lambda Function` which will be triggered in the events of the **two-minute warning**  
You organize your code into `Lambda functions`. Lambda runs your function only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second.   

- Trigger   
    A trigger is a resource or configuration that invokes a Lambda function. This includes AWS services that you can configure to invoke a function, applications that you develop, and event source mappings.  
- Event   
    An event is a JSON-formatted document that contains data for a Lambda function to process. The runtime converts the event to an object and passes it to your function code.  

[Reference Page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-concepts.html#gettingstarted-concepts-function)  


### Monitoring 
`CloudWatch` is one of ways to monitor AWS services, but in Project 2 it requires to explorer other ways too.   

Here are a couple of recommendations from guideline.  
-  [ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack)
-  [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)


Here are simple explanations of above two programs.  
1. **What is the ELK Stack?**   
    "ELK" is the acronym for three open source projects: *Elasticsearch*, *Logstash*, and *Kibana*.   
    *Elasticsearch* is a search and analytics engine.   
    *Logstash* is a serverâ€‘side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to a "stash" like Elasticsearch.   
    *Kibana* lets users visualize data with charts and graphs in Elasticsearch.  

2. **What is Prometheus?**  
    Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. Since its inception in 2012, many companies and organizations have adopted Prometheus, and the project has a very active developer and user community.   
    Prometheus joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in 2016 as the second hosted project, after *Kubernetes*
